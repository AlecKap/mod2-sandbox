# Mod 2 Sandbox

This will be our Mod 2 "Big Repo" that holds various front-end practice exercises that we'll use through the module.

## Set Up

- Fork the repo
- Clone your forked repo with `git clone`
- `cd` into the cloned repo

## To run the code in any given file

Use the node command `node/folderName/fileName.js` to run any given file.  Swap out "folderName" and "fileName" with the actual names of the folder and file.
