## JS Party Exercises

The exercises in this folder provide hands on practice for Mod 1 students to work through as they complete this [JS Party Lesson](https://curriculum.turing.edu/module1/lessons/js-party) in preparation for Mod 2. 

The code in each file can be run using `node` followed by the file name.  

For example: 
`node js_party/data_types_and_variables_playground.js`


Students may find it helpful to move their VS Code terminal to the right of the file to better see the logged results.
